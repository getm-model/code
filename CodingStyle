In this file a few general rules for coding 'getm' are given.

0: Use of module, subroutine and function templates.
In the template directory example files of modules, subroutines and functions
are available. Please use those if you need to create a new file and please fill
in all relevant information - especially author and description.

1: Indentation
Since Fortran90 allows for free-format we don't have to stick to the column 7
rule. After a bit of testing we have chosen that each new level should be 
indented 3 blanks e.g..

   subroutine egon
   logical is_it_true
   integer i,j

   kaj = 1
   if (is_it_true) then
      do i=1,100
         j=i
      end do
   end if

   return
   end

And please don't put any blanks at the end of lines.

2: Upper and lower case.
We keep everything in lower case.

3: Variable naming conventions.
Highest priority is - readability - therefore we have chosen the C-style 
convention - where we use _ instead of mixed upper/lower case variable names.
Variables - especially public variables - should have a meaningful name
like in 'have_boundaries'.

4: Writing diagnostics.
A few pre-processing definitions have been defined in cppdefs.h to ease writing
 diagnostics and also to give diagnostics a consistent look. Have a look in 
cppdefs.h for the actual definitions. Here is just one example:

Instead of coding:
   write(0,*) 'Some diagnostic ouput'
use
   STDERR 'Some diagnostic ouput'

This makes it very easy to change the entire diagnostic system in the program
by simply changing the definition of STDERR in cppdefs.h.
To allow for different identations the following set of definitions have been
implemented:
LEVEL0 to LEVEL4 they are to be used as STDERR.

5: Import explicitely variables from modules. 
When other modules are used always use the 'ONLY' keyword and do only import
the variables actually needed. This give a much clearerpicture of the data 
flow in the programme.
